# Δv Calculator
> Calculate Δv for two stages and compare with Δv required for Hohmann transfer to different celestial bodies
>All Hohmann transfers assume an optimal ejection angle and a safe low orbit




Im sure this is stupidly complex for what it is. any optimization suggestions are HIGHLY appreciated
