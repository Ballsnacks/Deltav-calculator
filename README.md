# Δv Calculator
> Calculate Δv for up to two stages and compare with Δv required for Hohmann transfer to different celestial bodies

>All Hohmann transfers assume an optimal angle of ejection and a safe low orbit reletive to atmosphere Diameter




I'm sure this is stupidly complex for what it Does. Any optimization suggestions are HIGHLY appreciated 
>I'll test this on a linux machine when i get a chance, I hope it works for everyone  :)
